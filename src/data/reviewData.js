      "I had no clue where to start in learning Product design, then Axia Africa started an online training and I joined. Within few weeks of coaching I was able to understand both UX & UI. The classes are interesting and gives room to ask questions. Materials provided were helpful. It was a great to learning experience led by the fantastic teachers. I would highly recommend this training if you are a beginner",

      "Axia Africa’s product design class has been an eye opener and a good starter for me as someone who is a graphic designer but struggles a lot with UX in particular.  I’ve become more confident in my UX process and prowess as a designer and I won’t stop learning!. Thank you Axia.",

      "Axia Africa has been so helpful to me. I got into tech with zero knowledge of it, didn’t even know my way around a good system. But right now, I know more than I would’ve imagined that I can before I got into the academy. Very helpful, kind, patient and thoughtful teachers too. This training has really helped me! I highly recommend it! Thank youuu.",

      "Being someone with the passion to learn design, I found it hard to multitask between my days job and my passion for learning. Coupled with this, the fear of learning alone without mentorship made me doubt my ability to learn ui/ux. However, thanks to Axia Africa and their mentorship programs, I have been able to learn what I desired to learn in a convenient space at my own pace. Thanks Axia Africa",
